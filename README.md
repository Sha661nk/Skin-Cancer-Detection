# Skin Lesions Classifier
Welcome to the 'Skin-Cancer-Detection' repository, where we are dedicated to advancing the field of medical image analysis through the application of deep learning techniques. This repository houses a comprehensive approach to developing a Skin Cancer Detection Classifier, utilizing the powerful concept of transfer learning.

## Transfer Learning Overview:
Transfer learning is a cutting-edge technique in the realm of deep learning. It involves leveraging a pre-trained neural network model, originally trained on a vast dataset, and adapting it for a new, specific task. This method is highly efficient as it allows for the utilization of learned features and patterns from the extensive initial training, thereby reducing the need for large amounts of new data and computational power for training.

## Pre-Trained Models Used:
In this project, we have chosen some of the most renowned deep neural networks, known for their robustness and accuracy in image classification tasks. These include:

- **ResNet50:** Renowned for its deep architecture and residual learning framework.
- **VGG11:** Known for its simplicity and depth, focusing on convolutional layers.
- **DenseNet121:** Famous for its dense connections between layers, ensuring maximum information flow.
- **InceptionV3:** Notable for its computational efficiency and high accuracy, achieved through factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization.
These models have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale dataset with a wide variety of images. Their ability to recognize a vast range of features makes them ideal candidates for the task of skin cancer detection.

## Adaptation for Skin Cancer Detection:
The core of our approach lies in customizing these pre-trained models to specifically address the challenge of skin cancer detection. This involves a two-step process:

- **Model Modification:** The final layers of each pre-trained model are carefully removed to make way for new, task-specific layers. This is done to tailor the model's output to the specific requirements of skin lesion classification.
- **Fine-Tuning with Skin Cancer Dataset:** The newly added layers are trained with a curated dataset of skin cancer images. This dataset, though smaller in size compared to ImageNet, is highly specialized and contains various types of skin lesions, making it ideal for this purpose.
Through this methodology, we aim to achieve a high degree of accuracy in classifying different types of skin cancer, thereby contributing to early detection and better clinical outcomes. This repository is not only a testament to the power of transfer learning in medical image analysis but also a step forward in the application of AI in healthcare.
